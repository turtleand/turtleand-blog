## Rear-View Mirror and Today

So far, humans have focused on the 'How' — How do we execute tasks? How do we optimize processes? How do we achieve outcomes? This focus on execution has driven tremendous innovation and progress.

But now, with the advent of artificial intelligence, much of the 'How' is increasingly automated. Machines can handle many tasks at scale, quickly and efficiently. 

This shift presents an opportunity to step back and ask a different question: 'What'? What is the most important thing we’re trying to accomplish? What actions will yield the greatest value for the least effort? What’s the next logical step in achieving our goals? By asking 'What', we clarify our priorities and ensure that our efforts are aligned with meaningful objectives.


## The Next Question

Even though asking 'What' helps set a clear direction, by outlining the path we’ll take, there’s an even deeper and more crucial question: 'Why'. While 'What' defines the goals and actions, 'Why' reveals the underlying motivations, the long-term purpose, and the values driving those goals. Without asking 'Why', we may succeed in execution but fail to understand the true significance of our actions and decisions. This lack of understanding would not only limit our ability to innovate and adapt to change, but it would also prevent us from grasping the fundamental aspects of nature and humanity. It's in the 'Why' where we have the opportunity to understand the very core and underlying reasons behind the world around us.


## My own example

I applied the "5 Whys" technique (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys). However, I went further to explore a deep fear of mine. I was willing to see where the questions would lead, pursuing the root causes. The goal was to understand the underlying factors at play, and the process helped me uncover unexpected insights.

1️⃣ Why do I always want to earn more money?

> Because I feel financially insecure.

2️⃣ Why do I feel financially insecure?

> Because earning money is difficult. It often seems that people or the system aren’t particularly generous, and no one has my back.

3️⃣ Why does it seem like no one has your back, and the system isn’t generous?

> Because everyone is too busy trying to protect themselves.

4️⃣ Why is everyone so busy trying to protect themselves?

> Because we, as people, are hurt and afraid. We fear that someone more powerful will attack us and take what we have.

5️⃣ Why do we fear that someone more powerful will take what we have?

> Because it does happen sometimes, and when it does, it’s a very painful experience that leaves deep scars.

6️⃣ Why is it such a painful experience that leaves deep scars?

> Because people have abused that situation in the past, and likely still do today.

7️⃣ Why have people abused that situation in the past (and likely still do today)?

> Because it’s a short-sighted act, and they don’t think about the consequences.

8️⃣ Why do people act so short-sightedly, without considering the consequences?

> Because they act impulsively, without first asking 'Why', and they end up creating a cycle of fear, revenge, and hate.

9️⃣ Why do people act impulsively, without asking why first, and create a cycle of fear, revenge, and hate?

> Because they don’t focus enough on the why.

### Reflection: What Does This Reveal?

The 'Why' chain may have led to a profound insight: the root cause of financial insecurity isn’t just money — it’s a deep societal pattern of fear, short-sightedness, and a lack of reflection.

People act out of fear. They protect themselves, sometimes at the expense of others, because they don’t pause to ask why. This creates a cycle — one that leads to insecurity, inequality, and a lack of trust in the system.

If this is the case, how can you apply this realization to your own financial goals? Is earning more money the only solution, or could redefining security and trust play a role?

## The Challenge

Use your preferred, most advanced AI reasoning model to run the following (or similar) prompt:

> Imagine a world where everyone—from students to CEOs—starts every task by asking 'Why'. This shift doesn’t replace knowing 'How' or 'What', but it adds purpose to every action. Let’s explore how society might evolve over decades with this mindset by running a multi-decade simulation.

### Summary of my simulation

In the early decades, educators, business leaders, and community innovators began encouraging everyone to start with 'Why'. This early movement saw schools experimenting with purpose-driven lessons and companies rethinking their strategies to include clear, meaningful objectives. These initial shifts fostered deeper engagement, critical thinking, and a shared curiosity about the reasons behind everyday tasks.

As the mindset matured, institutions began to embed the “why-first” approach into their core practices. Educational systems redesigned curricula to prioritize inquiry and personal connection to learning, while corporations introduced “purpose audits” to ensure every project aligned with ethical and long-term goals. Even government policies were influenced, with public consultations becoming more common and sustainable strategies taking root in areas like renewable energy and healthcare.

In conclusion, the long-term embrace of asking 'Why' transformed society into a more reflective, purpose-driven community. This shift not only enhanced individual fulfillment and ethical innovation but also paved the way for more resilient institutions, equitable policies, and a sustainable future where actions are aligned with deeper, collective values.

## Call to Action

Create the habit of asking '_Why_' daily. **Why** does _this_ matter?
