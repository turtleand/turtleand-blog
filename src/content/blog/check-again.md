description: "AI tools change so fast that yesterday's best practice might already be obsolete. One simple habit can keep you ahead: search before you do."

I needed a banner image yesterday.

Nothing fancy. Just a clean header for a blog post. The kind of thing I've done dozens of times. My muscle memory said: fire up an AI image generator, write a detailed prompt, iterate three or four times, settle for something close enough.

Instead, I paused. Searched for five minutes. And found a completely different approach.

Turns out my AI assistant could write HTML and CSS, render it in a browser, and screenshot the result. Clean text. Clean gradients. Exact colors. No weird AI artifacts, no mangled typography, no "close enough." The method wasn't obvious a month ago. Today it produced better results than any image generator could.

Five minutes of searching saved me an hour of prompt wrestling. And gave me a better outcome.

That moment crystallized something I'd been feeling for a while.

## The half-life of "how"

The half-life of technical skills has dropped to about 18 months. That's not a guess. Research from Impact Lab and others tracks this collapse in real time. For AI-adjacent skills specifically, it's even shorter. The best way to do something in January might be the wrong way by March.

Consider the numbers. Stanford's 2025 AI Index found that inference costs for GPT-3.5-level performance dropped 280-fold in just 18 months. From $20 per million tokens to $0.07. That's not gradual improvement. That's the floor falling out.

In coding tools alone, the last two years have been a blur. GitHub Copilot dominated 2023. Cursor exploded in mid-2024 with a $60M funding round. Claude Code emerged. Codex re-launched as an agent-first platform. Each shift didn't just add features. It changed the optimal workflow entirely.

If you learned "the best way" to code with AI six months ago and never checked again, you're already behind.

## The Red Queen problem

In evolutionary biology, the Red Queen Effect describes how organisms must constantly adapt just to maintain their position. Not to get ahead. Just to not fall behind.

That's us now. With AI tools.

The thing is, most people don't realize they're running. They build a workflow, it works, and they repeat it. Which is rational. Why fix what isn't broken?

Because it is broken. You just don't know it yet. The cost of sticking with yesterday's approach isn't dramatic. It's invisible. It's the ten minutes you waste on a task that now takes two. The mediocre output when excellent is available. The friction you've normalized because you stopped looking for better.

## The 5-minute rule

Here's what I've started doing. Before any task that involves AI tools, I spend five minutes searching. Not researching. Not deep-diving. Just a quick check: "What's the current best way to do X?"

That's it. Five minutes.

Sometimes the answer is: nothing changed, carry on. Fine. You lost five minutes. But sometimes the answer rewrites your entire approach. And those moments compound.

A few examples of what this looks like in practice:

**Before generating an image:** "Best way to create blog banners with AI, February 2026." That's how I found the code-to-screenshot method.

**Before starting a coding task:** "Current best AI coding workflow." This is how people discovered Cursor when they were still defaulting to Copilot.

**Before writing a document:** "Best AI writing assistant right now." The answer changes every few weeks.

The key word is "current." Adding a date or "right now" to your search filters out the outdated guides that still rank on page one.

## Beginner's mind as strategy

There's a Zen concept called Shoshin. Beginner's mind. In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities. In the expert's mind there are few.

Most productivity advice tells you to build systems and habits. Repeat what works. Optimize. And for stable environments, that's right.

But we're not in a stable environment. We're in one where the tools transform weekly. Where 27% of white-collar workers now use AI daily, up 12 points from just one year before. Where the gap between "people who re-check" and "people who don't" widens every single day.

In this environment, expertise can become a trap. The expert says "I know how to do this." The beginner says "Let me look it up." Right now, the beginner's instinct is the correct one.

## What this really costs

I think about the people still manually writing code that an AI agent could generate in seconds. Not because they're stubborn. Because they learned their workflow in 2024 and it was good then. They never had a reason to check again.

The cost isn't just time. It's the slow drift between what you're capable of and what's actually possible. That gap used to grow over years. Now it grows over weeks.

90% of CEOs worry their teams lack the skills to adapt. But the problem isn't skill. It's the assumption that yesterday's skill still applies today.

## The simplest habit that changes everything

This isn't about being anxious or obsessive. It's not about chasing every new tool.

It's one habit: before you do the thing, search for how people are doing the thing right now.

Not last month's tutorial. Not the workflow you bookmarked in October. Right now.

Five minutes. That's the cost. And in a world where the ground shifts daily, five minutes of looking down might be the most productive thing you do all day.

The most important information is always what just happened. Because it hasn't been priced in yet. And it's what you can still act on.

Check again. Something probably changed.
