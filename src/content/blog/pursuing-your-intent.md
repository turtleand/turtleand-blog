## The Expiring Skill

Right now, knowing how to configure a specific AI instance on a specific cloud platform is important. It builds a real competitive edge. I'm actively catching up with it myself. But if I look at the pattern — command lines gave way to GUIs, GUIs to touch, touch to voice — every generation of tooling trends toward invisible usability. The specific skill that matters today won't be the ultimate differentiator. I don't know exactly how to bridge that gap. But I suspect that working through this stage, engaging deeply with the tools as they are now, is part of how we discover what ultimately matters.

But something doesn't expire. Your intent. The drive to solve the thing that keeps you up at night. The urge to fix what's broken in your corner of the world. That has never become obsolete, and it won't start now.

## The Closing Gap

Every major technology shift has followed the same arc: the tool disappears into the background. Command lines required memorizing syntax. GUIs replaced that with pointing and clicking. Touch screens removed even the pointer. Voice removed the screen. Each step made the tool more invisible — and shifted the question from "can you operate this?" to "what do you want to do?"

AI follows this trajectory. The gap between having an idea and executing it is closing. Not slowly — rapidly.

This is exciting and uncomfortable at the same time. If the tool disappears, then the people whose value was tied to *operating* the tool face a real problem. That's not abstract. That's people's livelihoods. I'm not going to pretend otherwise. But the direction is clear, and understanding it is better than ignoring it.

## Agency Doesn't Become Obsolete

Skills are what you *can* do. Agency is what you *want* to do. They're different things, and they age differently.

When a factory worker's manual skill was automated, the loss was devastating — not just economically, but personally. Years of expertise rendered irrelevant overnight. But the *desire* to build, to create something useful, to provide for a family — that didn't go away. The tools just couldn't channel it anymore. The skills were gone, and nothing replaced the path from intent to action.

Now something is different. AI doesn't just automate execution — it opens execution to anyone with intent. A person who knows *what* needs to happen but doesn't know *how* to code, design, analyze, or build can now get much further than before. The tool meets you where you are.

I'm not naive about this. The transition hurts. The gap between losing a skill-based job and channeling your agency through new tools is a real gap, with real bills. I don't have a neat answer for that. But I do think recognizing that agency survives — even when skills don't — matters for how we think about what comes next.

## Jevons' Paradox of Human Purpose

In the 1860s, economist William Stanley Jevons observed something counterintuitive: as coal engines became more efficient, coal consumption didn't drop but rather exploded. More efficiency meant more uses. More uses meant more demand. This became known as [Jevons' paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox). And the term has been widely cited lately in relation with technology and AI.

The same logic applies to problem-solving. As AI makes it more efficient to address challenges, we won't run out of problems. We'll find *more* problems worth solving. Problems we couldn't even see before because we didn't have the capacity to address them. Problems that were too small-scale, too niche, too local, too complex for any individual or underfunded team.

The more capable the tools, the more human intent has places to go. Not fewer.

## An example of problem solving

How can the kind of challenges that real people with intent and powerful AI tools could actually tackle look like?

A retired urban planner who always noticed that her city's bus routes haven't changed since 1987, while the city has transformed completely. She uses AI to analyze actual movement patterns, population shifts, and accessibility gaps — then publishes an open proposal that anyone can build on. Reshaping how a city moves, starting from one person's observation.

This wouldn't guarantee income and wouldn't mean a job by any means. But yet it would be valuable. And it would have been difficult with the previous available tools.

## The Honest Gap

Let me name the tension directly: pursuing your intent doesn't pay the bills. At least not automatically, not yet.

I'm not going to pretend that new economic models will magically appear to reward every act of agency. The gap between "creating genuine value" and "earning a living" is real, and I don't have a clean answer for closing it.

But I've noticed something. When people create genuine value — the kind that changes a neighborhood, preserves a language, helps a child learn — other people notice. Other people care. Value has a way of finding its way back, even if the path isn't clear yet. That's not an economic theory. It's an observation.

I don't have the answer to this. I just don't believe the answer is to stop pursuing what matters.

## Clustering

Something else is changing alongside the tools: the ability to find each other. People with aligned intent — who care about the same creek, the same language, the same gap in the system — can now connect more easily than ever.

Small groups, organized around a shared challenge, armed with AI tools that amplify their collective agency. Not a company. Not a nonprofit. Just people who noticed the same problem and decided to do something about it.

This isn't a replacement for jobs. It's a parallel force. While the employment landscape evolves — and yes, the uncertainty is real and alarming — this other reality of people solving problems together could unfold alongside it. Not utopia. Something more modest: small groups creating tangible outcomes. Harmony over disruption. Sustainability over speed. Positive outcomes while minimizing negatives.

## What's Sitting in Your Peripheral Vision?

Think about the problem that's been sitting in your peripheral vision. The one you've noticed for years but couldn't do anything about. The broken process, the unmet need, the gap nobody's filling. Now ask: what if you could?

Not "what if someone could." What if *you* could. With intent, with tools that are more accessible every day, with the ability to find others who see the same problem.

The skill that gets you there might change. The tool might change. But the drive to get there — your intent — that's yours. It doesn't expire.

## Call to action

Describe the problem that matters to you as specifically as you can. What's broken? Who's affected? What would better look like? Then ask an AI to help you understand the problem space — not to solve it, but to map it. The first step isn't execution. It's clarity about what you actually want to change.
