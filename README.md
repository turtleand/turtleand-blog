# Turtleand Blog

Turtleand is my personal blog for reflections on building, learning, and the
human side of technology. I write to think clearly, test ideas in public, and
leave a trail of lessons for my future self.

## Philosophy

- Clarity over noise: fewer posts, deeper thinking, and practical takeaways.
- Intentional growth: progress comes from small, consistent improvements.
- Human-first tech: AI and systems should amplify judgment, not replace it.
- Curiosity with rigor: explore broadly, but verify and refine.
