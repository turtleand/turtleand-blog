May there be errors or inacurate things in the posts? Certainly! Even
when I do efforts to analyze, double-check, and review the posts. I aim
to deliver factual, accurate and useful content, and stay true to
myself. Dear reader, please bear with me. I'm a human being, therefore I
can make mistakes. But it's the purpose of this blog to share my
learnings along the way, in pursuit of making a better version of our
past-selves.
